## Arabic OCR Character Model

This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model specifically designed for recognizing Arabic characters.

## Overview

Arabic OCR is a challenging task due to the complexities of the Arabic script, which includes various ligatures, diacritics, and contextual forms. This model utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately recognize Arabic characters from images.

## Features

- Recognizes Arabic characters from images
- Supports various fonts, styles, and sizes
- Preprocessing pipeline for image enhancement
- Trained on a large dataset of Arabic characters

## Usage

To use the Arabic OCR model, we recommend the usage of Google Colab for easier execuation and faster data processing
